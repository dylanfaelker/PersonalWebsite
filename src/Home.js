                  Running has always been important to me. In grade 3, I joined the cross country team and continued with the sport all the way until grade 12 where it was cancelled due to COVID.
                  In grade 9, I started taking it seriously when I signed up for my first race with my mom. It was a 10km and I came 3rd in my age group.
                  In grade 10, I trained throughout the summer for cross country in the fall and secured my placement at OFSAA which is something I am still proud of.
                  I took a break for a while but once COVID hit, I used running as something to do and ran over 1000 miles in 2020. 
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                  In the first summer of the pandemic, I started road biking with a couple big goals in mind. The first two were biking to the CN Tower in Toronto and back (100km), something I have now done 3 times, and biking to Niagara Falls and back (200km).
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                  My final goal was a half Ironman. I had planned to try one in the summer of 2021 but COVID had other plans. I still hope to do one soon, and eventually complete even a full Ironman.
