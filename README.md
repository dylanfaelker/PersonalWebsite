<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/dylanfaelker/PersonalWebsite/issues) for a list of features and fixes I would like to add to the website. I originally made this website when I was first learning computer science in university and didn't know any web development techniques. As such many parts of this website are poorly made and far from my current skill set. I am actively working on updating things, but this isn't a major priority for me.
